# Quit a running instance of THIS build BEFORE its bundle is deleted below. Left
# running, it becomes a process whose bundle no longer exists — LaunchServices
# still lists it as open, so the next `open build/Pretype.app` tries to ACTIVATE
# that corpse instead of launching the new build and fails with -600 ("The
# application is not open anymore" in Finder). The rebuild then looks like it
# worked while nothing new is actually running.
# Both commands are anchored on the absolute build path (the script has already
# cd'd to the repo root): a released copy installed in /Applications may be
# running alongside the source build, and rebuilding here is no reason to shoot
# it. The pkill pattern still ends at the bare executable, so a diagnostic run
# (`--dictation-probe`), whose command line carries the flag, survives the
# rebuild it is being used to debug.
# Gated on pgrep because `tell application ... to quit` LAUNCHES a non-running
# app just to deliver the quit event — every clean rebuild would flash the old
# build's menu-bar icon for nothing.
# pgrep/pkill -f take an ERE, so the checkout path must be matched literally —
# a clone under something like "proj (1)" would otherwise never match and the
# stale process would survive the rebuild.
